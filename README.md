# Le2LeJosEv3-RoboDoz3r
This is the LEGO® Mindstorms EV3 **RoboDoz3r Robot** example program in the Java programming language that uses a Java Implementation of _LEGO® Mindstorms EV3 Programming Blocks (icons)_ on LeJOS EV3. 

You can find the building instructions and the LEGO® icon-based program of the _RoboDoz3r Robot_ in the LEGO® icon based (LabView-based) Programming Environment (Home Edition).
The _RoboDoz3r Robot_ is one of the Robot Remix models.
You can download the LEGO® Programming Environment at https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/downloads/download-software (or one of the other language pages).

## Dependencies
This project depends on the **Le2LeJosEv3** Library (see https://github.com/robl0377/Le2LeJosEv3) that sits on top of the current version of the LeJOS EV3 framework. 
Please copy the classes in the _Le2LeJosEv3_ Library packages _le2lejosev3.pblocks_ and _le2lejosev3.logging_ into this project's source directory before running it.

In this project I am using the **LeJOS EV3 v0.9.1beta** framework (see https://sourceforge.net/projects/ev3.lejos.p/) and a standard LEGO® Mindstorms EV3 Brick.

## Resources
The program uses several sound files that are in the project's _resources_ directory. 
Please upload them to your EV3 Brick via SCP to the directory _/home/lejos/lib_.

The **sound files** are converted from those MP3 sound files found at www.thumb.com.tw/images/blog/lego_ev3_sound_files/ev3_sounds.zip.
There are several ways to convert the MP3 sound files to WAV. 
I was using the online converter at https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav. 
Be sure to set _Change audio channels:_ to _mono_.
